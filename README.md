# AI4Health-Online-Experimentation

This is the code base for the practical session titled "Online learning and experimentation algorithms in mobile health."

## Requirements
- Most of the work is in ipython notebooks (see below for links/description).  You can open these locally or use Google Collab (link for each file can be found by opening the file directly on github).
- Files to for the HeartSteps simulator are saved on "Google Drive" (link in [`part2_offline.ipynb`](https://github.com/wdempsey/AI4Health-Online-Experimentation/blob/main/part2_offline.ipynb).  
- The simulator was built in R.  One part of the simulator could not be converted in time to Python. __Therefore__, attendees are encouraged to download [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/).
